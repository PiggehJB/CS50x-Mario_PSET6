--Less Comfortable:

Check if user input (pyramid_height) is less than 9 but greater than 0. Also make sure it's an integer 

Add hashtag_counter to send '#'s in numerical order: hashtag_counter = height - (height - height -1)
Add +1 to hashtag_counter per loop

Add space_counter to send spaces with the '#'s: space_counter = height - 1 
Subtract -1 to space_counter per loop

Multiply print * space_counter for spaces
Multiply print * hashtag_counter for hashtags

loop to see if hashtag_counter is greater than pyramid_height. If so, pyramid is complete

pyramid height = 4:

---# | space_counter = 3, hashtag_counter = 1
--## | space_counter = 2, hashtag_counter = 2
-### | space_counter = 1, hashtag_counter = 3
#### | space_counter = 0, hashtag_counter = 4

"Your pyramid is completed"

--More Comfortable:

Same as Less Comfortable, simply add 2 spaces and print another set of hashtags while printing pyramid

pyramid height = 4:

---#  #| space_counter = 3, hashtag_counter = 1
--##  ##| space_counter = 2, hashtag_counter = 2
-###  ###| space_counter = 1, hashtag_counter = 3
####  ####| space_counter = 0, hashtag_counter = 4
