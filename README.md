This was made by me alone and I DO NOT promote cheating of any sort. By using this code you are violating the Academic Honesty Guidelines (https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/). 
This was made as an educational source for those who have already finished the problem set and would like to see my code for education purposes only.

Note: I'm not using the cs50x provided library, just pure python along with the colorama module which can be installed using the following:

pip install colorama
pip3 install colorama
conda install -c anaconda colorama
(Depending on your os/python)
